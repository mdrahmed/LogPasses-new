# Message_arrived and publish function loggin passes

The messageAndPublish2.cpp will work fine for instrumenting code inside those functions. 
- messagearrivedPublish.cpp is logging only one message_arrived function
- messageAndPublish2.cpp is logging all message_arrived and publish functions
- funcCalls.cpp is logging all the functions and values.
- PubMsgArrWorked.cpp is working for publish functions
- **valueMsgPub.cpp contains code that will get function names, arguments and values**
