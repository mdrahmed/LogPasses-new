Functions with Arguments folder contains functions_analysis.cpp pass which logs function names with it's arguments.

Functions with values folder contains funcAnalysis.cpp pass which log function name with it's values in hex.

Print pass folder contains functions that will simply add a printf inside each basic block, but there are some repo's that also contain print pass.


Check the Makefile to understand.
